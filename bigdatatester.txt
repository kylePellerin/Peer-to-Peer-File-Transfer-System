Chapter 10
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.

In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.
Figure 32. Patrol volunteers of Kekexili. Still from Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-
making. Instead, his work explores the balance between aesthetic quality
and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-
making. Instead, his work explores the balance between aesthetic quality
and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.

262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.
Figure 32. Patrol volunteers of Kekexili. Still from Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

to protect antelopes from poachers. Two members, Suonan dajie and
Zhaba duojie, lost their lives in gunfights against poachers. For more

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-
making. Instead, his work explores the balance between aesthetic quality
and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.

262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

Notes
1. The “Wild Yak Brigade” was a volunteer group that patrolled Kekexili
to protect antelopes from poachers. Two members, Suonan dajie and

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-
making. Instead, his work explores the balance between aesthetic quality
and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.

262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.
Figure 32. Patrol volunteers of Kekexili. Still from Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-
making. Instead, his work explores the balance between aesthetic quality
and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.

262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.
Figure 32. Patrol volunteers of Kekexili. Still from Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-
making. Instead, his work explores the balance between aesthetic quality
and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

“Ma,” a common family name among the Hui minority concentrated in
the Qinghai region. The film’s portrayal of these minority groups invites
reflection on how minority identity can transcend cultural and ethnic
differences.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.

In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.
Figure 32. Patrol volunteers of Kekexili. Still from Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.

For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-
making. Instead, his work explores the balance between aesthetic quality
and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.

In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.
Figure 32. Patrol volunteers of Kekexili. Still from Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-
making. Instead, his work explores the balance between aesthetic quality
and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns

In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.

For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

to protect antelopes from poachers. Two members, Suonan dajie and
Zhaba duojie, lost their lives in gunfights against poachers. For more

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-
making. Instead, his work explores the balance between aesthetic quality
and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.

262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

Notes
1. The “Wild Yak Brigade” was a volunteer group that patrolled Kekexili
to protect antelopes from poachers. Two members, Suonan dajie and
Zhaba duojie, lost their lives in gunfights against poachers. For more

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-
making. Instead, his work explores the balance between aesthetic quality
and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.

262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.
Figure 32. Patrol volunteers of Kekexili. Still from Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-
making. Instead, his work explores the balance between aesthetic quality
and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.

262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.
Figure 32. Patrol volunteers of Kekexili. Still from Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-
making. Instead, his work explores the balance between aesthetic quality
and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

“Ma,” a common family name among the Hui minority concentrated in
the Qinghai region. The film’s portrayal of these minority groups invites
reflection on how minority identity can transcend cultural and ethnic
differences.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.

In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly

murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.
Figure 32. Patrol volunteers of Kekexili. Still from Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.

Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-
making. Instead, his work explores the balance between aesthetic quality
and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.

In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.
Figure 32. Patrol volunteers of Kekexili. Still from Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.

Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-
making. Instead, his work explores the balance between aesthetic quality
and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns

In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.

For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

to protect antelopes from poachers. Two members, Suonan dajie and
Zhaba duojie, lost their lives in gunfights against poachers. For more

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-
making. Instead, his work explores the balance between aesthetic quality
and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.

262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

Notes
1. The “Wild Yak Brigade” was a volunteer group that patrolled Kekexili
to protect antelopes from poachers. Two members, Suonan dajie and
Zhaba duojie, lost their lives in gunfights against poachers. For more

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-
making. Instead, his work explores the balance between aesthetic quality
and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.

262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.
Figure 32. Patrol volunteers of Kekexili. Still from Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-
making. Instead, his work explores the balance between aesthetic quality
and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.

262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.
Figure 32. Patrol volunteers of Kekexili. Still from Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-
making. Instead, his work explores the balance between aesthetic quality
and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

“Ma,” a common family name among the Hui minority concentrated in
the Qinghai region. The film’s portrayal of these minority groups invites
reflection on how minority identity can transcend cultural and ethnic
differences.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.

In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly

murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.

(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 251
Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-

and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.

Kekexili-Mountain Patrol:
Tibetan Antelopes and
Wilderness through the
Lens of a Man with a Camera
Lu Chuan’s Kekexili-Mountain Patrol immerses its audience in the Tibetan
wilderness, where the collision between poaching and the protection of
antelopes unfolds through the lens of a Beijing journalist.1. This chapter
examines how the film establishes a photojournalistic perspective that
portrays the Tibetan wilderness and its antelopes as gendered Others.
Depicted as virginal terrain with treacherous conditions, Kekexili chal-
lenges both human endurance and imagination. The Tibetan antelopes,
particularly the female and pregnant ones slaughtered during the calving
season, embody the violence of poaching and the ruthless exploitation
of nature by commercial interests. Yet this perspective struggles to
reconcile the moral complexities surrounding antelope killing, as it
confronts entangled viewpoints on animal ethics. For the impoverished
peasants who turn to poaching and the volunteers who patrol the wilder-
246 Ecological and Environmental Turns
ness, moral consideration of nonhuman animals is jeopardized by two
competing forces: the exploitative international fashion industry on one
hand and the economic hardships of local ethnic minorities on the other.
The director’s commitment to capturing a compelling human-animal
encounter imbues Kekexili with a documentary-like quality, further
intensified by its docudrama effect. As the tragic heroes sacrifice their
lives for a noble cause and antelope fur continues to supply consumer
markets, the film concludes its exploration of the wilderness with justice
unmet and its mission left unaccomplished.
Figure 32. Patrol volunteers of Kekexili. Still from Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
(dir. Lu Chuan, 2004).
The Animal Turn through the Man with A Camera
In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, film director Lu Chuan adopts an animal-
centric perspective, focusing on Tibetan antelopes caught between relent-
less poachers and determined protectors. Known locally as chiru, these
antelopes have become an endangered species due to global demand for
their underfur. The anthropogenic incursion into the wilderness, driven
by economic exploitation, has unleashed violence both against animals
and among humans. The pre-credit sequence plunges the audience into
a stark and bloody reality, where poachers and patrollers clash over
the fate of Tibetan antelopes—one group hunting them for the illegal
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 247
fur trade, the other striving to shield them from extinction. Following a
tracking sequence in which poachers shoot antelopes with semiautomatic
weapons, the camera captures the simultaneous deaths of a patroller and
an antelope. In a point-of-view shot from the perspective of a captured
patrolman, the film forces the audience to witness the brutal killing of
an antelope. Alternating close-ups of the animal’s slaughter and flaying
with the execution of the captured patroller confront viewers with the
visceral brutality of the scene. The juxtaposition of these deaths compels
reflection on the intersectionality of human and nonhuman suffering.
The immediate question posed by the film title, Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol, is how the stories will be told and from whose perspective. The
film’s animal-centered narrative unfolds primarily through the point
of view of a photojournalist, mediated by the lens of his camera. The
pre-credit sequence begins with a voice-over narration accompanied
by images of antelopes roaming the open landscape. The voice-over
informs viewers that Kekexili is the last natural reserve for these animal
inhabitants. This peaceful imagery abruptly dissolves into a close-up
of a dismembered body, followed by a wide-angle shot of a mass of
carcasses. A man with a camera in the film is photographing the scene,
while the voice-over continues, “Hundreds and thousands of antelopes
have been slaughtered for the needs of European and American markets
since 1985. The population has declined from over a million to less than
20,000.” The juxtaposition of the voice-over and the photographic images
immerses the audience in the violent conflict between local volunteers
patrolling the reserve and poachers intent on killing antelopes for their
pelts. This perspective, directing the audience’s gaze to the slaughtered
antelopes and a once-pristine land now subjected to global-commercial
exploitation, frames the animal as a moral dilemma embedded within
a narrative of uncertainty.
The journalist’s perspective guides outsiders into an unfamiliar wilder-
ness, the habitat of a threatened species. As the film director explains:
248 Ecological and Environmental Turns
I need a journalist to use as a mirror, to reflect the events. But
his observations are from an outsider’s perspective; I wished for
him to express my own reactions. When I went to Kekexili it was
a very affecting experience—seeing all the antelope carcasses,
vultures circling around – but we’re mostly viewing the situation
from an outsider’s perspective.2
Serving as the film director’s “mirror” or alter ego, the photojour-
nalist from Beijing embodies a geopolitical division between central
authority and marginal space, creating a discursive negotiation between
the speaking and the spoken. The journalist’s position, legitimized by
the advantage of centrality and the authority of media, grants him the
power to report and document. In contrast, the ethnic minorities on the
socioeconomic periphery remain largely voiceless and invisible, fearful of
speaking out. This dynamic becomes evident in the creation of an antelope
patrol. Initially, the local community is hesitant to welcome outsiders.
For instance, a shot/reverse-shot sequence briefly positions the patrol
leader, Ritai, and the journalist, Gayu, as oppositional figures. However,
when Gayu introduces himself as a journalist from Beijing seeking to
report on Kekexili, he gains immediate acceptance. The locals, facing
urgent challenges in their mission to protect the antelopes, recognize the
necessity of external administrative and financial support for their cause.
The reporter, arriving as an outsider, possesses a dual ethnic identity—
half Tibetan, half Chinese. This duality positions him to be perceived as
either an “us” (Tibetan) or a “them” (Han Chinese). While this us/them
dynamic enables his voice-over to narrate the story and his photographs to
expose the brutal reality, it also complicates negotiations between urban
and rural, center and periphery, and dominant group and ethnic minority.
The reporter’s partial Tibetan heritage facilitates his participation in
the patrol mission, local traditions such as sky burials, and community
life. Simultaneously, his Han Chinese identity as a journalist dominates
both the film’s narrative and its narration. Although his Chinese-Tibetan
identity legitimates the discourse of antelope protection and mediates
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 249
between “us” and “them,” it also complicates the moral evaluation of
human and nonhuman animals. For the Wild Yak Brigade, the imperative
to chase antelope poachers reflects not only their commitment to animal
protection but also their Buddhist beliefs and their struggle for survival.
For the journalist, however, his participation in the expedition is driven
by a desire to uncover and report news previously unknown to the public.
Questions arise as to whether the Beijing journalist can fully compre-
hend and convey the patrol’s seemingly suicidal obsession with protecting
the antelopes or whether the central government can bring order to the
frontier. For the film director, positioning the journalist as his alter ego
provides a critical perspective for observing the wilderness, a narrative
lens through which to frame the story, and a discursive vehicle to repre-
sent the mountain patrol in Kekexili. In addition, the director’s voyage
through the unforgiving landscape enables a deeper engagement with
local culture and opens cinematic possibilities beyond those explored in
his previous filmmaking experience.3 The landscape functions as both a
visual and symbolic space where notions of good and evil, humanity and
nature, and life and death are reconsidered. For the audience, this terrain
simultaneously invites and resists the projection of wishful imagination.
Viewers are confronted with the brutal reality of antelope poaching yet
remain helplessly distanced from the violence they witness.
Body of the Antelope and Image of the Landscape as
Gendered Other
The animal turn begins with the mise-en-scène of antelope carcasses
strewn across the barren wilderness of Kekexili. Hundreds of lifeless
bodies and discarded pelts dominate the screen, presenting a stark contrast
between human brutality and animal vulnerability—one that surpasses
conventional notions of environmentalism. The journalist’s camera
lens frames the landscape and animals as gendered Others. Situated
approximately 4,700 meters above sea level, Kekexili stands as the last
natural reserve for Tibetan antelopes. Revered by locals as “the beautiful
mountain and the beautiful girl,” the topography intertwinesmasculine
250 Ecological and Environmental Turns
power with feminine beauty. The feminine aspect is embodied in its
untouched terrain, where “one’s footprints could be the first left by
humankind.”4 The sublime imagery of snow-covered mountain peaks,
expansive deserts, and silent water captivates both the camera and the
audience. Conversely, the masculine force is manifested in the landscape’s
inherent dangers—violent snowstorms and sudden, fatal accidents that
underscore nature’s destructive power. Yet Kekexili serves as more than
a mere backdrop. As both the narrative framework and a discursive space
for human conflict, this remote wilderness—conceived as Otherness—
simultaneously invites and resists cinematic representation.
While serving as the film’s primary mise-en-scène, Kekexili functions
as both the natural habitat for Tibetan antelopes and, in particular, the
calving ground for pregnant females. The virgin land and the pregnant
body enable a reading of the film from an ecofeminist perspective and
through the metaphor of the animal body. “The poetics and politics of
feminist ecocriticism” make it possible “to reassess the material and
discursive connections between human and nonhuman environments
from feminist viewpoints.”5 Ecofeminism asserts that the body matters,
and this assumption can be extended to include the animal body matters,
particularly the female animal body. As Terri Field argued, the body
is “indispensable to ecofeminism.”6 This idea is powerfully illustrated
through the disturbing imagery of flayed carcasses at the calving ground.
In a wide-angle tracking shot and open-space mise-en-scène, over 500
antelope pelts stretch to the horizon. A group point-of-view shot captures
the patrollers alongside the journalist mourning the animals’ deaths and
providing them with a Tibetan burial. The sequence frames the journalist
simultaneously as an observer an active participant, bearing witness to
the brutality of the antelope massacre.

Figure 33. Open-space mise-en-scène featuring antelope pelts.
For the local patrollers, the antelopes are their inhabitants partaking
in the native land. For the journalist, the question of violence between
humans and animals both confounds and challenges his—and by exten-
sion, the audience’s—anthropocentric perspectives. In one sequence, for
example, the patrol leader, Ri Tai, explains to the journalist that it is
the calving season and that mother antelopes and their offspring are
slaughtered with guns. In response, Ga Yu asks about the whereabouts
of the captured poachers. The juxtaposition of sound and image creates
a moment of disorientation, intensified by a close-up shot of bullet holes
puncturing an animal pelt. With the bodies removed and only the pelts
remaining, the pregnant and maternal antelopes are reduced to gendered
commodities—victims of sexualized violence designed to satisfy the
demands of the global fur trade and fashion industry.
In her article “Sexualized Violence and the Gendered Commodification
of the Animal Body,” Kathryn Gillespie stated that attention to the
animal body “extend[s] geographies of the body to other-than-human
bodies,” which “ultimately reveals the pervasiveness of sexual violence
and the consequences of gendered commodification for both nonhuman
and human others.”7 The expansive concept of geographies of the body
creates a direct connection between the virgin land of Kekexili and the
physical vulnerability of the antelope. This relationship is particularly
252 Ecological and Environmental Turns
evident in the migratory patterns of female antelopes, who travel 300
to 400 kilometers each May and June to reach their traditional calving
grounds in the north. After giving birth, the mothers and their calves
make the return journey south in July and August to their autumn-
winter range.8 The migratory journey underscores a gendered animal
geography: female antelopes undertake the solitary journey north to give
birth and later return south with their offspring.9 During this vulnerable
period, pregnant and nursing antelopes face deadly threats from poachers
armed with automatic weapons—phallic extensions of human violence.
The image of the animal body, riddled with bullets and stripped of
its pelt, symbolizes a form of feminized victimization. Through this
imagery, the film interrogates the underlying forces contributing to the
environmental crisis.
As the antelope is reduced from a living creature to a flayed and
discarded carcass, its dismembered body evokes the concept of the “absent
referent,” as proposed by Carol J. Adams.10 The absent referent, Adams
explained, signifies that “behind every meal of meat is an absence: the
death of the animal whose place the meat takes.”11 Similarly, behind
every commodity made from antelope fur lies an absence—the death of
the animal, concealed and replaced by the marketable product derived
from its body. In this sense, the pelt both physically and metaphorically
severs the connection between the animal’s life and the consumption
of its underfur. To satisfy global demand and provide consumers with
luxury Shahtoosh,
12 the slaughter of antelopes begins with the violent act
of stripping the animal’s body from its skin. The pelt is then processed
into the finest wool for the market. As consumers acquire Shahtoosh, the
absence of the antelope remains a haunting presence at the site of its
brutal death. The concept of an absent referent thus critically reveals “how
a process of objectification, fragmentation, and consumption enables
the oppression and exploitation of animals so that animals are rendered
being-less through technology, language, and cultural representation.”
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 253
The absent referent encompasses not only the slaughtered animals but
also the brutal and thriving illegal trade in antelope fur. Hunted and killed
for their pelts to produce Shahtoosh shawls, the antelopes are victims
of a chain of merciless profiteers—poachers, the fur trade industry, and
the global fashion market. Positioned against the backdrop of a capitalist
corporate system operating behind the scenes, the endangered wildlife
and fragile landscape underscore the urgent need for media exposure,
legal intervention, and cinematic investigation. Although the illegal fur
trade and the fashion industry’s demand for Shahtoosh operate on a
global scale, they remain largely invisible—both to the audience and
within the film itself. Yet these distant, unacknowledged forces bear direct
responsibility for the endangerment of Tibetan antelopes. Those involved
in the production and consumption of antelope wool products remain
anonymous actors within a larger industrial network. As Amy J. Fitzgerald
and Nik Taylor explain, “how they normalize consumption of animal-
derived products and therefore protect their own financial interests
and the status quo of a capitalist system grounded in the industrialized
production and procession of animals for human consumption more
generally.”13 The fashion industry and consumer culture thus actively
bridge two extremes: the pursuit of beauty and luxury with the profound
suffering of animals. As Chia-ju Chang observed, the ultimately film
fails to “relate transnational capitalism to exploitation of non-western
human subaltern and animals.”14
The feminization of the antelope also symbolizes the subjugation of
the Tibetan Other, subjected to ongoing ethnic and political control.
The current violence of poaching and the commercial exploitation
evoke historical parallels, such as the British expedition to Tibet in the
early twentieth century or the Communist Party’s militant intrusion in
the 1950s.15 Ethnic marginalization and political oppression persist in
Tibet today through the implementation of economic policies and “re-
education” programs enforced by the central government. While the
film portrays the antelope as a feminized victim, it briefly extends this
portrayal to human female figures. Excluded from men’s life-and-death
254 Ecological and Environmental Turns
struggles and confined to domestic or commercial places, women are
identified with nature and primary needs, positioned to nurture men with
body or beauty. For example, the woman speaking in Sichuan dialect
is a migrant who works at the local bar and sex districts. Her identity
is framed solely through her relationship with a patrolman, serving to
provide him with sexual and financial comfort following his dangerous
expeditions in the wilderness. Similarly, the Tibetan girl, marked by
her exotic beauty and ethnic minority status, seems to exist only as a
visual object for the male gaze. In the harsh and perilous environment
of Kekexili, there is no space for women’s narratives. Consequently,
efforts to protect wildlife and confront violence and exploitation unfold
within a predominantly masculine discourse. As a result, the female
animal body is cast as prey, while the human female is relegated to an
insignificant role. This association between women and nature offers
no promise of liberation. As ecofeminism contends, “we cannot liberate
nature or...nonhuman animals without taking the oppression of women
seriously...we cannot liberate women without taking the oppression of
nature or specifically nonhuman animals seriously.”16
Dilemma of Animal Ethics
While foregrounding the dismembered animal body, the journalistic
perspective confronts a moral dilemma concerning justice for both
humans and animals. The dilemma becomes particularly paradoxical when
it involves the intertwined fates of both nonhuman animals and marginal-
ized human ethnic groups. The peasants-turned-poachers and the volun-
teer patrol members— comprising impoverished Muslim Chinese and local
Tibetans—are minorities relegated to the socioeconomic periphery.17 This
hybrid identity not only challenges conventional oppositions between
ethnic groups but also blurs the distinction between heroes and villains.
Caught in this ambiguity, the journalist and his camera frequently oscil-
late between the conflicting sides. On one hand, the journalist seeks to
intervene in actions he perceives as violent or unlawful; on the other,
his journalistic perspective often complicates the very moral standards
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 255
he aims to uphold. His dual role as both a moral agent and the narrative
lens of the film intensifies this paradox, leaving the boundaries between
justice and complicity increasingly unclear.
For instance, the photojournalist frequently turns his camera towards
the “villains” and engages with their stories. Through this framing,
the poachers—excluding the armed organizers—resist being defined
by conventional moral standards due to their shared ethnic identities
and marginalized socioeconomic positions. The film grapples with the
complex question of how to represent minority identities when they
encompass both poverty-driven peasants and Tibetans of low socioe-
conomic status. This tension challenges the narrative structure and
the ethics of representation. In one tracking sequence, a conversation
between the journalist and Ma Zhanlin, the leader of the peasants-turned-
poachers, offers insight into the economic motivations behind antelope
poaching. The audience learns that poverty, rather than malicious intent,
compels these individuals to hunt antelopes. Ma Zhanlin explains that
he was once a shepherd but could no longer sustain a livelihood after the
grasslands became desertified and his herds starved. As the most skilled
member of the group, he earns only five yuan (approximately US$0.65)
for flaying a single animal. By incorporating this minority voice, the film
prompts the audience to move beyond simplistic moral judgments and
consider the deeper causes of poverty and the socioeconomic pressures
that drive the illegal killing of Tibetan antelopes.
The challenge of recognizing the treatment of nonhuman animals as a
moral issue necessitates engagement with the principles of animal ethics.
One perspective on humanity’s ethical relationship with nonhuman
animals is rooted in Buddhist philosophy. “The Buddhist tradition,” as
Paul Waldau explained, “has affirmed in almost countless ways that
humans are obliged to pay attention to those other living beings we
are capable of noticing, and to take those beings seriously in an ethical
sense.”18 Within Buddhist precepts, the foremost ethical commitment is
to refrain from killing: “the commitment of not killing any living being
256 Ecological and Environmental Turns
is a foundational ethical undertaking...killing animals was, in a sense at
least, as serious as killing people.”19 From this Buddhist perspective, it
becomes understandable why members of the patrolling team are willing
to risk their lives to prevent the massacre of antelopes, whom they refer
to as “our chiru.” However, viewed through a socioeconomic lens, the
actions of farmers who turn to poaching antelopes can be interpreted as
driven by economic necessity rather than malice.
The film, however, does not critically examine either the ethical or
socioeconomic implications of the conflict. Instead, it remains ensnared
in moral ambiguity. The journalist and his camera actively pursue justice
but ultimately uncover that violence and unlawful behavior are present
on both sides—among the patrol group as well as the poachers. While
poachers sell antelope pelts for personal profit, the patrollers similarly
engage in the sale of pelts to finance their operations. In its depiction
of violence, the film draws uneven moral lines. There is no ambiguity
when the sympathetic camera captures a poacher coldly executing a
patroller with a gun. However, the camera lens seems to lose focus—both
literally and figuratively—when patrollers violently beat their captives.
Despite these brutal acts, the film blurs the boundary between heroes
and villains, showing that both sides are capable of mercy. In one chase
sequence, for example, as patrollers pursue escaping prisoners, both
groups suffer from oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude environment.
When a patroller collapses, nearly dying from pulmonary congestion,
his young adversary stops to help him.
While the lines between heroes and villains blur and both poachers and
patrol members occupy similar positions at the socioeconomic margins,
the film positions the journalist and his camera as the primary agents of
justice and the authoritative speaking subject. In the final chase sequence,
for instance, Gayu challenges Ritai by asserting that selling pelts is illegal.
Ritai responds to this accusation by stating, “I understand that selling
pelts is against the law, but what concerns me most is Kekexili and my
friends. Haven’t you seen those performing prostration? Their hands and
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 257
faces are dirty but there’s beauty in their hearts.” This exchange marks a
pivotal moment in which the Beijing reporter and the Tibetan volunteer
directly confront their conflicting values. However, the tension between
them cannot be solely attributed to ethnic difference. Embedded within
this confrontation are deeper dynamics: the power relations between
the speaking subject and the spoken object, the clash between official
ideologies and indigenous moral frameworks, and the broader conflict
between urban modernity and Tibetan cultural traditions.
In his analysis of ethnic minority writing, Joseph Pivato asserts that
the representation of an ethnic minority inherently assumes a political
position. The question of who is speaking and from what perspective
inevitably involves power relations. Moreover, when an outsider to
a marginalized group presumes to speak about or on behalf of that
group’s experiences, both aesthetic and political challenges arise.20
From an ecofeminist perspective, ethical care for animals requires a
“dialogical method”—meaning that individuals must “care about, pay
attention, and listen to what animals are telling us”—and a “political
perspective” that allows us “to analyse the situation critically in order
to determine who is responsible for animal suffering and how it may
best be alleviated.”21 Assuming the position of the speaking subject —
without fully understanding how to represent both ethnic minorities and
nonhuman animals—the journalist begins to doubt the camera’s ability
to capture the complexities of this cultural conflict. Gayu wonders, “I’m
a journalist, how can I draft a reliable report?” Ritai responds satirically,
“Thanks to you journalists, Kekexili can survive.”
In this exchange, the film reveals its attempt to assert media authority
over both the environmental catastrophe and the marginalized minority
Other. However, this intention is disrupted when the Other resists
representation and speaks back. The divide between Gayu and Ritai
runs deeper than surface-level disagreements, as demonstrated when
Gayu questions whether the prisoners and patrollers left behind will
survive the harsh desert. Rather than directly answering, Ritai repeatedly
258 Ecological and Environmental Turns
murmurs, “wish it won’t snow, wish it won’t snow,” acknowledging that
a snowstorm could claim any life—hero or villain alike. This moment
compels the audience to reflect on the contrasting concerns of Ritai, who
is preoccupied with survival in a deadly environment, and Gayu, who
remains focused on fulfilling his journalistic duty in line with his moral
code. As an outsider—and thus an unreliable narrator—Gayu struggles
to fully grasp the patrollers’ near-suicidal devotion to their seemingly
impossible mission.
The film raises critical issues but ultimately leaves them for the
audience to contemplate. First, would Kekexili and its wildlife receive
adequate protection if the government genuinely prioritized its western
plateau? Although Kekexili is officially designated as a conservation
area under China’s environmental law, the region was largely neglected
by authorities until the murder of local volunteers and the resulting
international media attention. Operating outside the official system, the
local patrols have long struggled with insufficient funding, personnel
shortages, and a lack of firearms. Second, would impoverished peasants
participate in the antelope pelt trade if they were not burdened by
economic hardship and social or institutional neglect? The film also
gestures toward the poaching organizations’ leaders and the escalating
demands of global capitalism as the true threats to Tibetan antelopes but
fails to explore these issues in depth. Notably absent is any depiction of the
international market for antelope wool products, particularly the luxury
Shahtoosh, which underscores the need for a global ethical framework
regarding the exploitation of endangered species. Defining animal ethics
within the context of transnational dynamics remains deeply challenging,
given the intricate relationships among social hierarchies, local economies,
and global capitalist systems. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect the
film to address every issue and question surrounding its narrative and the
tragic expedition that ends in death. However, the film’s closing scene
powerfully confronts the limitations of media representation. In the final
moments, the journalist can do nothing but watch as a poacher kills Ritai
before his eyes; his camera remains utterly powerless. This harrowing
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 259
image raises a profound question: Can a journalist with a camera—and,
by extension, the media—truly uphold moral principles and advocate for
the preservation of wildlife in the face of such violence?
The Tragedy of Life and Death via Docudrama
The inserted journalistic perspective ultimately recognizes that the
conflict between antelope poaching and efforts to prevent it transcends
a mere clash of interests over animal welfare. The film also serves as
a profound exploration of survival and unwavering faith in the face of
overwhelming adversity. “The primary search of the film,” as the film
director explained, “seeks neither antelope defense nor environmental
protection but rather surviving the impossible conditions of treacherous
nature. Most importantly, what the film pursues is one’s faith and belief
beyond life and death.”22 With life and death as its central theme, the
film fundamentally explores how human survival is measured against
a moral code in the struggle with nature. The antelopes function as
symbolic representations, reflecting both the violence of poaching and
the urgency of rescue efforts. However, the film’s engagement with the
“animal turn” remains distinctly anthropocentric rather than ecocritical.
For example, the film both begins and ends with human sacrifice in the
name of protecting slaughtered antelopes. In the opening sequence, the
mise-en-scène juxtaposes two brutal acts: one poacher flays an antelope
while another executes a captured patrolman. This spontaneous and
horrific contrast portrays wildlife and human life as equally vulnerable to
violent brutality. The film’s conclusion mirrors its beginning, reinforcing
the theme of life and death in the pursuit of animal protection. A wide-
angle shot captures Ritai encircled by armed poachers. Unarmed, Ritai
demands their surrender, believing that justice will prevail over violence.
Yet, the film deliberately avoids a melodramatic resolution between
oppressor and victim. In a chilling parallel to the slaughter of antelopes,
a poacher shoots Ritai, and the head poacher mercilessly fires additional
rounds into his body. The narrative closes in a moment of tragic stillness,
as both the story and its noble hero meet a devastating end.
260 Ecological and Environmental Turns
The film positions its protagonist in the ambiguous space between a
tragic hero and a social victim. Despite possessing moral strength and
pure intentions, the protagonist ultimately fails to overcome evil and
instead sacrifices his life for a just cause. However, the mission to protect
wildlife and impose order in the lawless wilderness does not originate
from heroism alone; it is deeply rooted in Tibetan cultural values. Yet the
film leaves these cultural foundations largely unexplored, constrained
by the narrative perspective. The Tibetan-led patrols, self-organized and
operating independently of official authority, had been active for years
before the production of Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. Two of their leaders
lost their lives in confrontations with poachers.23 Out of respect for
their sacrifice, the film deliberately avoids melodramatic embellishment.
The “heroes” are portrayed as doomed to die, and their moral mission
collapses into despair. The human-animal conflict between poachers
and patrollers is thus reframed through the aesthetics of tragedy. In
this portrayal, moral strength and personal sacrifice require no further
justification when an individual stands defenseless against armed forces
driven by global economic imperatives. It is the certainty of death that
intensifies the tragic narrative, making the suffering both excessive and
deeply unsettling. Columbia Pictures, the film’s production company,
urged director Lu Chuan to craft an uplifting ending—one where heroes
outfight villains and justice triumphs over evil. Lu Chuan firmly rejected
this request, maintaining that he could not compromise the film’s core
vision: an uncompromising portrayal of life-and-death tragedy.
Beyond the human conflicts at the film’s core, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
powerfully evokes a life-and-death struggle against the formidable and
indifferent forces of nature. The destructive power of snowstorms and
the treacherous conditions in Kekexili pose equal threats to poachers,
patrollers, and even the film crew. In one striking panoramic shot, a group
of captured peasant-prisoners is ordered to stand in line. This is followed
by a close-up two-shot framing the patrol leader, Ritai, and the head
peasant, Ma Zhanlin, in direct confrontation. Lacking sufficient supplies
to sustain the prisoners, Ritai decides to release them. However, Ma
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 261
Zhanlin refuses the offer, knowing that trekking 300 kilometers through
the storm-ravaged wilderness would mean certain death. Ritai coldly
responds, “It’s your fate if you fail to make it.” The film then depicts
the released peasants trudging through the freezing terrain, battling
fierce winds and blinding snow. In a series of dissolves, one man after
another collapses, prompting the others to strip clothing from the fallen
to survive. This harrowing sequence strips away moral distinctions,
reducing both villains and heroes to equally vulnerable figures before
the merciless power of nature. The narrative then cuts to three patrol
members left behind due to a fuel shortage, similarly struggling to
escape the storm-lashed wilderness. The film’s engagement with nature’s
unforgiving force extends beyond the screen to its production. The
treacherous conditions during filming presented real-life dangers. Alex
Graf of Columbia Pictures tragically died in a car accident on-site, and
nearly half of the crew either resigned or abandoned the production due
to the life-threatening environment.
Figure 34. Heroes and villains are equally powerless against nature.
262 Ecological and Environmental Turns
While death functions as a visual device to intensify the film’s tragic
mode, it also imparts a documentary quality to the narrative. Kekexili:
Mountain Patrol is a feature film grounded in real events, with Lu Chuan’s
script drawing directly from actual incidents and historical figures as
primary sources. The film’s authenticity is further reinforced by on-
location shooting in Kekexili and the casting of local people to play
themselves—excluding the three leading roles—encouraging the audience
to view the film as a faithful recreation of real-life events. Additionally,
the narrative is punctuated by calendar dates, with each day linked to a
specific geographic location. This chronological and spatial progression
enhances the film’s documentary-like realism. However, despite this
structured timeline, the unfolding expedition remains fraught with
unpredictability. Moments of joyful reunion among patrol members
may be abruptly disrupted by deadly confrontations with poachers.
This balance between temporal-spatial continuity and unforeseen events
grounds the film in documentary realism while simultaneously amplifying
its dramatic tension. Steven N. Lipkin, in his analysis of film and television
docudrama, explains that “the overall thrust of docudrama is neither
exposition nor logical argumentation, but persuasion...Docudrama strives
to persuade us to believe that what occurred happened much as we see
it on the screen.”24
In examining how docudrama constructs persuasive narratives, a
critical strategy involves intensifying tragedy without inducing exces-
sive emotionality. In Kekexili: Mountain Patrol, the most unexpected
and impactful death occurs when patrol officer Liu Dong is suddenly
consumed by quicksand. Liu’s jeep breaks down at a crucial moment when
the stranded team is anxiously waiting for him to deliver supplies. As he
attempts to unload the vehicle and diagnose the mechanical failure, Liu
inadvertently steps into quicksand. Within mere seconds, he is engulfed,
and what remains is the stark abruptness of his death and an unsettling
silence. This sudden and unceremonious loss of life produces one of the
most haunting and forceful death images in the film. Liu’s inescapable and
irreversible demise evokes terror and a profound sense of helplessness,
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 263
drawing the audience deeper into the film’s tragic atmosphere. According
to the director’s shooting noted, this death scene was intentionally
crafted to heighten the film’s tragic dimension. Lu Chuan acknowledged,
“quicksand is quite uncommon in Kekexili, but I decided to include the
scene to enhance the sense of tragedy.”25 The carefully constructed mise-
en-scène and the staged death sequence underscore the fragility of life
and invite reflection on the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction.
This blending of documentary realism and dramatic effect is central
to the film’s rhetorical strategy. The documentary elements authenticate
the environmental crisis threatening the Tibetan antelopes, while the
dramatized moments amplify the urgency of the situation. However, it
is essential to recognize that docudrama does not merely reproduce or
reconstruct real events and figures. Any depiction of real-life occurrences
on screen is inevitably shaped by narrative structure and visual design.
The general audience may struggle to distinguish between documented
reality and dramatized embellishment—such as the inclusion of the
quicksand scene—illustrating how elusive and contentious the concept
of docudrama can be.
264 Ecological and Environmental Turns
Figure 35. Fatal descent into quicksand.
In addition, the film director must navigate the tensions between
ideological messaging and commercial demands. Kekexili: Mountain
Patrol concludes its otherwise tragic narrative with an unexpectedly
optimistic epilogue: “Gayu, the journalist, returned to Beijing. His reports
astonished the world. A year later, the Chinese government declared
Kekexili a national natural reserve and established the Forest Public
Security Bureau. The population of Tibetan antelopes is back to 30,000
and still growing.” This abrupt shift from the film’s harrowing portrayal
of death and sacrifice to a reassuring resolution feels disjointed. However,
such a tonal shift is unsurprising given the need to accommodate official
narratives, audience expectations, and commercial interests. While the
epilogue may offer viewers a sense of closure and relief through the
promise of government intervention, it simultaneously raises unsettling
questions. The lives lost in the struggle against poaching cast doubt on
the true efficacy of a newly established security bureau. Can Kekexili’s
fragile ecosystem be genuinely preserved, and can Tibetan antelopes be
safeguarded from exploitation amid intensifying commercial pressures
Kekexili-Mountain Patrol 265
and the expanding influence of Han Chinese authority on the Tibetan
plateau?
The film’s animal turn , presented through the lens of a Beijing photo-
journalist, immerses the audience in the rugged wilderness of Kekexili and
the precarious existence of its endangered Tibetan antelopes. This inserted
perspective exposes the violent conflict between poachers seeking to
profit from antelope pelts and vigilant local volunteers determined to
protect the species from extinction. Yet, this anthropocentric viewpoint—
centered on human action rather than ecological interconnectedness—
ultimately falters in its attempt to define moral justice, as the lines blur
between impoverished farmers turned poachers and self-organized local
patrollers. To move beyond this anthropocentric framework toward an
environmental and ecological perspective, the film invites reflection on
the deeper connections between exploitation of the natural world and
gendered violence. The slaughtered antelope bodies, particularly females
targeted during the calving season, exemplify the link “between the
exploitation of women and the exploitation of nonhuman animals.”26
The wildness of Kekexili, with its dual character of masculine power
and feminine beauty, simultaneously challenges and resists romanticized
or reductive portrayals of nature. In reconciling moral principles with
animal ethics, the film suggests that human–nonhuman relationships
need not be predicated on domination. This perspective sheds light on
why members of the Wild Yak Brigade willingly sacrifice their lives to
protect the chirus. As the narrative unfolds across the unforgiving Kekexili
landscape, the film operates as both a docudrama depicting a life-and-
death struggle between humans and nature and a cinematic exploration
of the boundary between reality and representation. Ultimately, the film
leaves viewers to confront the unsettling truth that the preservation of
Tibetan antelopes and the conservation of Kekexili’s wilderness depend
less on local Tibetan efforts and more on curbing economic exploitation
and global capitalist intrusion.

3. Before directing Kekexili, the young filmmaker—new to the industry—
chose not to align himself with either mainstream or independent film-
making. Instead, his work explores the balance between aesthetic quality
and commercial appeal. In his directorial debut, The Missing Gun (2002),
the theme of searching for a missing gun—and, by extension, a man’s
lost identity—draws the audience into psychological tension and visual
suspense. Kekexili continues this theme of searching; however, the pur-
suit of environmental resolution and moral justice in the film leads to
an uncertain outcome.
